 Kosmas:these rule are a cheap substitute of a Bayes Network. If there is time, we will properly implement one.
 Rule 1: if (wants-to-impress=a lot and experimental=yes)-> only serve Experimental Food
 Rule 2: if (wants-to-impress=a lot and gourmet=yes)-> only serve Gourmet Food
 Rule 3: if (wants-to-impress=a bit and experimental=yes)-> one dish is Experimental
 Rule 4: if (wants-to-impress=a bit and gourmet=yes)-> one dish is Gourmet
 Rule 5: if (wants-to-impress=a bit) -> one dish is to Gourmet or Experimental
 Rules 6-9 : if (season = x (one of Winter, Summer, Autumn, Spring) -> only serve food that is fresh on season x
 Rule 10 : if (children=many) -> one dish has to be highly friendly
 Rule 11:  if (children=medium) or (children=few)-> one dish has to be averagely friendly
